    title: "Paid internships from IIT, NIT & big companies - Are they worth it?",
    problem: "Paid internship from IIT, NIT & big company collaboration, is there any free internship that is more valuable and is it ok to enroll in paid training internship?",
    solution: "Doing paid internship is just like buying a course with a certificate and this kind of thing is just a business. A real internship is full of responsibility, management, stress, learning, implementation, collaboration, and this happens when you work in real projects in startups and companies.\n\nNowadays we see many business vendors that tie-up with IIT, NIT & other companies and using their name they sell high fees courses, internships, workshops.\n\nSo the question is if there are free opportunities, resources, and everything available freely, so why would you pay? You just need awareness and you get everything. So here I will share some techniques to get internships freely and some organizations that give you internships surely.",
